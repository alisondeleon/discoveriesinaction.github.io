## Doing developmental science using remote research
Over the last three years, our lab ([Conceptual Development and Social Cognition Lab at NYU](www.kidconcepts.org)) has been developing [Discoveries Online](www.discoveriesonline.org), a platform for doing unmoderated remote research with children. 

On this website, we detail our strategies for conducting remote research and how to host a remote study using Discoveries Online. 

In addition to this website, we provide more details on our experience conducting online research in our pre-print, Advancing developmental science via unmoderated remote research with children.
