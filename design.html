            This guide provides a series of step for creating studies for a digital format 
            using narrated videos that children can work through independently on an online platform 
            (e.g., using our online platform Discoveries Online). 

            We walk through the process of animating your study (using either Keynote or PowerPoint) 
            and setting up your study online (using Qualtrics). Of course, other programs and applications may also work, 
            and some steps may not apply to all studies. Please feel free to use this guide as appropriate for your 
            specific study!</p>

                Before beginning our step-by-step guide, we wanted to give you some examples of what you can accomplish

                <h3>Benefits</h3>   
                <p>
                One major benefit is the ability to observe the behavior of children and their parents in a 
                more naturalistic home setting without the intrusion of having a researcher physically present. 
                For example, this method is uniquely suited to studies of parent-child conversations and interactions. 
                Since families can participate in studies easily, by just clicking on a link, this forum is also 
                ideal for gathering longitudinal data. <br><br>
                See <a href="https://osf.io/htn7z/" target="_blank">here for
                an example of a multi-session study</a> examining parent-child conversations about gender that 
                we are currently running in this way.

                <h3>Make your script child-friendly for unmoderated research</h3> 
                <p>
                   Throughout your study, be sure to think about how a child who cannot yet read would know 
                   what they are supposed to do. Certain phrases might not be on the script of an in-person 
                   study but will need to be recorded for an online study. These may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="icofont-check"></i>Natural transitions between tasks (e.g., <span class="font-italic">"Alright, 
                        let's try another game."</span>)</li>
                    <li><i class="icofont-check"></i>Debriefs and thank you's (e.g., <span class="font-italic">"Thanks for 
                        all your help!"</span>)</li>
                    <li><i class="icofont-check"></i>Response options for forced-choice questions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   Describing the choice options by reading them out loud⁠—or better yet, 
                   animating them⁠—is important to help children complete studies as independently as possible. This is key 
                   for <a href="parents.html">minimizing the chance of parent interference</a>.

                    <li style="padding: 0;"><i class="bx bx-plus"></i>You can code for anything that can be reliably captured

                <h3>Find the "breaks" in your script</h3>   
                <p>In prep for animating in Keynote or PowerPoint, you'll need to think about where you will 
                    want to put your “breaks” between slides. This is usually where you need to change the 
                    stimuli that is being presented on the screen or where you want to ask a question that 
                    requires a response from the participant.</p>

                    For example, here is the first few sentences from a script of one of our studies and 
                    where we inserted breaks:<br><br>

                <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><i>First, I'm going to ask you some questions about all the people in 
                    the whole wide world! <b>[break – switch to next slide]</b> What kind of car do most families 
                    have? A really old and broken car, a really new and nice car, or somewhere in between, 
                    like this one, this one, or this one? <b>[break – switch to next slide]</b> What kind of house 
                    do most people live in? A really small and broken house, a really big and nice house, or 
                    somewhere in between, like this one, this one, or this one? <b>[break – switch to next slide]</b></i></p>

                <p>It is usually pretty obvious where breaks will be needed, but it is helpful to have them clearly 
                    marked to make the animating process go more quickly. In addition, it is helpful to be mindful 
                    of maintaining a balance between not splitting the script into too many slides (in order to 
                    minimize the number of recordings and the amount of programming in Qualtrics needed) yet also 
                    keeping the slides short enough that the resulting videos will run smoothly (we try to keep most 
                    videos under or around 30 seconds).</p>

                   When preparing your audio for your study, you have a number of options available to you. 
                   You can record the audio directly using your animation software (e.g., directly in Keynote or PowerPoint) 
                   as you are building your animations, or you can record it in advance using audio recording software. 
                   Both strategies have their benefits, and it’s up to you to decide which strategy makes the most sense 
                   for your project. However, in the long term, it is likely to your benefit to record audio separately using

                          <p>Using the audio tools already available on your computer may be enough for what you need, 
                          but in some cases, you may find the additional features of professional-grade software useful 
                          for ensuring you have the best audio quality possible for your studies. For example, while 
                          the most effective way to fix bad audio recordings is to simply re-record the audio, there 
                          might be cases where that is not an option for you (e.g., time constraints, the person who 
                          recorded the audio is no longer available). Professional software makes it possible to 
                          filter out background noises and to splice together audio in a way that sounds more 
                          natural than what you can do with simple audio recording tools.</p>

                <h4>General best practices for recording audio</h4>
                <p>Here's a few general tips to ensure that you have good quality audio for your study</p>
                <ul style="margin-left:1em">
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i><b>Do all the recording in one session.</b> 
                      Otherwise, sometimes your voice sounds slightly different or the volume recorded 
                      might be slightly different.</li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i><b>Have one person do all the recordings for one study.</b>
                       This keeps the audio consistent.</li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i><b>Use earphones or a microphone.</b> These will likely provide 
                      better recordings than the default microphone available in your computer.</li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i><b>Record in a quiet environment.</b> Make sure to turn off 
                      noisy appliances (e.g., the fan, air conditioner, dishwasher, washing 
                      machine, etc.). One of the best places acoustically to record audio is 
                      actually your bedroom or coat closet! If you can fit inside it, the small 
                      space and the clothing help to dampen background noise.  </li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i>Before doing all your recordings, <b>do a few practice tests</b>
                       to make sure the audio sounds good </li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i>When recording, <b>pause for a couple of seconds before and 
                      after the sentence.</b> You’ll have to trim these spaces out later, but this ensures 
                      that your audio doesn’t get cut off while recording and makes it easier to trim out 
                      mouse clicking (from starting the recording) or the noises your mouth makes as you 
                      prepare to talk. Additionally, if you have to later edit out background noise from 
                      your audio, these spaces make it easier for audio software to accurately remove that noise.</li>
                    <li><i class="bx bx-plus"></i><b>Repeat the same line multiple times without stopping the recording,</b> 
                      and splice out the version of the line you like most. You may find that this strategy helps 
                      you produce a more naturalistic audio recording.</li>

                <h4>Basic Steps</h4>
                <p> Below, we first outline the basic steps you will need to go through to 
                  create your animations using Keynote. However, there are several workflows 
                  you can use as you go through each of these basic steps. Each workflow has 
                  their own pros and cons, and you may find that one workflow works better for you.</p>

                          <p>If you plan to record your audio using Keynote, it’s helpful to first create 
                            blank slides and copy and paste the script to a new Keynote file’s presenter notes section. 
                            For instance, this is how the few sentences from our earlier example will look like in Keynote.</p>

                          <p>To record, simply go to the slide that you would like to record for and click 
                            Insert → Record Audio. When recording, you will want to leave a couple of seconds 
                            before and after the sentence to ensure the best audio quality (see general tips for audio here). 
                            <br><br>
                            After recording, click on the edit button circled below:

                            <br><br>
                            Then, trim the recording to cut the extra time before and after the actual recording 
                            (as shown below). Be sure to remember to actually click on the scissor icon 
                            (as circled below) to ensure that the audio clip trims, and then click Done.

                            <div class="center_box">

                            The last step is to click Insert (as below) to ensure that the audio

                            <p>Alternatively, if you recorded your audio using another application,
                              you can import audio by simply dragging the audio file from the folder
                              it's stored in directly onto the appropriate Keynote slide(s).

                            <br><br>
                            Whatever the purpose of it is, the way to set up an animation is the same: simply 
                            select the object (i.e., picture, text box, shape, etc.) that you want animated, 
                            click Animate at the top-right corner, and select the type of animation you would 
                            like to add from the three categories (Build In, Action, Build Out; the Build In 
                            and Build Out animations are simply transition animations that will allow the object 
                            to appear or disappear, and the Action animation will allow the object to move without 
                            appearing or disappearing, such as a jiggle or a slide). </p>

                            Before exporting, remember to always preview all of your slides first to ensure that 
                            the audio recordings and animations run smoothly. One potential issue that sometimes 
                            comes up is that the volume might still sound different for different slides. To 
                            adjust the volume for each audio clip, click on that specific clip and then 
                            select Format on the top right corner. Then, you will be able to adjust for 
                            volume (as circled below).

                            When you have ensured that your slides are ready, there are two ways that you 
                            can export your animations: through slide-recording or through manually exporting each slide.</p> 
                            
                            <h5>Slide Recording</h5>
                            <p>As you walk through your presentation, you can capture video by screen recording. 
                              This strategy of exporting is particularly pertinent if you are narrating your study
                              as the animations play.</p>

                            <h5>Manually exporting videos</h5>
                            <p>To manually export videos, select File → Export To → Movie. You will have to 
                              export slide by slide for each video, so enter the slide number that you would 
                              like to export for both From and to. Enter 0 for the fields Go to next slide 
                              after and Go to next build after and then click Next. Choose the folder in 
                              which you wish to save the slides and name the slide by either number or content 
                              to help you differentiate between the exported movies (the default name for all the 
                              exported movies will always be the name of the Keynote file). Repeat for all of 
                              your slides.<br><br>

                              This step is fairly straightforward and is the last step before moving to Qualtrics. 
                              The only small note for this step is that, sometimes, based on your recording 
                              and animation lengths, the last frame in an exported movie might be a black 
                              screen. If this happens, feel free to trim the last few milliseconds of your 
                              movie to avoid the black screen showing up in your actual survey presentation.<br><br>

                <h4>Different workflows for doing animations in Keynote</h4>
                <p>Above, we have outlined the basic steps for creating animations in Keynote, but 
                  there are a number of different workflows you can use to create animations. To 
                  illustrate each of these workflows, we will walk through the five methods using 
                  the same slide as an example.</p>

                <div class="accordion-col">
                    <div class="tabs">
                      
                      <div class="tab">
                        <input type="radio" id="workflow_key1" name="rd">
                        <label class="tab-label" for="workflow_key1">Workflow #1: Record all the sentences 
                          for one slide in a single audio clip (in Keynote) and then time the animations accordingly</label>
                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/animation1.png">
                            </div><br><br>

                          <p>In this slide above, we have five different animations that 
                            we want to set up. We want the first house to jiggle at “a really small and 
                            broken house”, the fifth house to jiggle at “a really big and nice house”, 
                            and the second, third, and fourth house to jiggle at the three “this one’s”, 
                            respectively. Using the first method, we will drag the entire 13-second audio 
                            recording to the beginning of the Build Order list. For the first animation, we 
                            will time how many seconds are supposed to pass before it (i.e., how many seconds 
                            before the first house should jiggle). In this case, it should be 2.5 seconds, so we 
                            will select After Build 1 under Start and then put in 2.5 seconds under Delay 
                            (as circled below).</p>

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/animation2.png">
                            </div><br><br>

                            <p>It is also fine to just guess how long the delays are in between animations, 
                            use the Preview button to gauge  if it is a little too long or too short, and 
                            then adjust accordingly.<br><br>

                            Continue the above steps for all your animations on that slide (set Start as 
                            After [previous animation] and set Delay to be the number of seconds needed 
                            after the previous animation). After working through all the animations, preview 
                            them to make sure that they run smoothly.<br><br>

                            One issue that we sometimes run into is that the audio might run longer than the 
                            last animation – in this case, the audio recording will get cut short after the 
                            last animation finishes (e.g., after the fourth house jiggles, the recording might 
                            still have not played the word “one”). Most of the time, you do not want to extend 
                            the last animation to be longer than necessary (e.g., make the fourth house jiggle 
                            for a longer period of time than the other houses), so one way to work around this 
                            is to randomly select an object and add a Scale animation to it. Set Scale to be 
                            100% and Duration to be the number of seconds before the audio recording ends (as 
                            shown below). That way, the audio will not be cut short until the end of this “animation”.

                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>Taking the same slide as an example, we could also record separate recordings 
                            for each animation (“What kind of house do most people live in?”/ 
                            “A really small and broken house,”/ “a really big and nice house,”/ 
                            “or somewhere in between, like this one, this one, or this one?”). A benefit 
                            of using this method is the possibility of recycling audio recordings when there 
                            are certain sentences/clips you will need for multiple slides (e.g., in this study, 
                            we use “or somewhere in between, like this one, this one, or this one?” ten times 
                            and by recycling this clip, we can both save time and ensure consistency). A tip 
                            for using this method is to place the multiple recording clips over their 
                            corresponding objects/animations (as shown below). This way, you can easily 
                            remember which audio recording goes in which place. One added benefit to this 
                            method is that recycling clips is often ideal for different conditions in a 
                            study, since you can ask the same question identically across conditions if 
                            you use the same audio clip.<br><br>

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/animation4.png">
                            </div><br><br>

                            The rest of the building order process is about the same as the previous method. 
                            Another benefit of using this method is that it usually decreases the number 
                            of times you need to estimate delay times, because for audio clips and 
                            animations that go together, you can just directly select “With [previous build]” 
                            for Start and not put anything for Delay.<br><br>

                            One potential problem with using this method, though, is that your recordings 
                            might not flow as well as with the previous method. One way to work around 
                            this is to still do the audio recording in one session and then just split 
                            it to multiple clips based on your animations (to do so, copy and paste as 
                            needed and then trim). Another way to deal with it is to combine this method 
                            with the previous method when necessary. For example, for really short sentences 
                            (e.g., “this one, this one, or this one”), it may not be as necessary to have a 
                            separate clip for each animation, so we can just have one clip for the last three 
                            animations, but separate clips for the first two animations.<br><br>

                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>This strategy is very similar to one previously described, except that all 
                            recordings are done in a different audio recording software, such as QuickTime. 
                            After individually recording each audio clip, you can simply drag the audio 
                            file (saved to your Desktop, or to another easily accessible folder) into 
                            the appropriate Keynote slide(s). The audio file will automatically become 
                            incorporated into your animation Build Order; as a default, it will be set to 
                            start “On Click.” Once all of the audio recordings have been imported into 
                            Keynote and arranged as you would like in the Build Order (whether each is 
                            timed to occur after a certain number of seconds, as in Strategies 1-2, or each 
                            is set to start “On Click”), it is time to record your slide(s). You can do so 
                            either using the screen record function, as described in Strategies 1-2, or by 
                            recording directly in Keynote. To do so, you can use the “record slideshow“ 
                            feature in Keynote (navigate to Play → Record Slideshow). Here, you can either 
                            just click once to start the set of pre-timed animations and audio recordings, 
                            or you can click on each animation/audio recording as you go if they have been 
                            set in your Build Order to “On Click.” Once your recording is done, you will 
                            export it as a movie file (see Step 7); only once a recording is exported can 
                            you clear it from Keynote (Play → Clear Recording) and start recording a new slide.

                          <p>Another approach to recording your slide is to arrange all animations to 
                            start “On Click”, and to use the “Record Slideshow” feature in Keynote (navigate 
                            to Play → Record Slideshow). This is very similar to the other screen-recording 
                            option in Strategy #5, where you click at timepoints when you want your animation 
                            to play. However, in this approach, you are narrating your presentation in real-time, 
                            rather than using pre-recorded audio clips. Some of the benefits to using this 
                            feature are that (1) your presenter notes will be available to you at the bottom 
                            of the page to organize and read through, (2) you can clearly keep track of how 
                            long your recording is, and (3) you can see the upcoming animation “builds” or 
                            slides on the left side panel, as a reminder (see image below). Using this strategy, 
                            you will want to export into video format after each recording, by clicking File →

                            Similar to the first method, you can do all your recordings for each slide within one 
                            audio clip. Arrange the audio to be at the beginning of your animations (as shown below). 
                            Then, arrange the order of your animations as desired and select “On Click” under Start 
                            for each animation. Then, record your slides by using the “Record Slideshow” feature 
                            described above in Strategy #5. While presenting, click at timepoints when you require 
                            an animation (e.g., click for the first time when the audio plays “a really small and 
                            broken house” so that the first house will jiggle).<br><br>

               <h3>Steps for creating a child-friendly study</h3> 
               <p>This tutorial assumes you have some existing (albeit limited knowledge) of Qualtrics. 
                  If you have never used Qualtrics before to create a basic survey (e.g., if you do not 
                  know how to create a new survey, add a new question, or what a block is on Qualtrics), 
                  then we recommend first looking through some of these tutorials to get started.<br><br>  

                  If you have used Qualtrics before, you’ve probably noticed that the survey features 
                  aren’t necessarily designed with young children in mind. Below, we’ve outlined the steps 
                  that we have found so far to be the most useful for creating a child-friendly survey, in 
                  particular, one where ideally the child is able to answer most questions without parent 
                  assistance. </p>
               <div class="accordion-col">
                    <div class="tabs">
                      <div class="tab">
                        <input type="radio" id="qualtrics1" name="rd">
                        <label class="tab-label" for="qualtrics1">Breaking up your survey into blocks and trials</label>
                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>You might think that it’s intuitive to have your survey structured so that 
                            each block contains a single task in your study. However, we have found it useful 
                            to have separate blocks for each trial because it allows you to keep track of when 
                            participants are completing each trial. Qualtrics allows you to record timing data 
                            for the onset and offset of any block, but not the onset and offset of questions 
                            within a block.<br><br> 

                            With that timing data from the onset and offset of a block, you can use 
                            Datavyu to sync children’s responses on Qualtrics with the participant’s 
                            webcam video (see here for more detailed instructions about how to record 
                            the timing of blocks, and how to import this information into Datavyu to 
                            link it to the participant’s video). This allows you to know exactly which 
                            trial a child is seeing throughout the video. This is useful for a variety 
                            of reasons, including being able to exclude individual trials in which 
                            there was possible interference without having to discard all of the 
                            participant’s data (see here for more information on interference and the 
                            role of parents), or allows you to easily match children’s verbal responses 
                            to the questions or stimuli they saw.

                          <h4>Type #1: Creating buttons over still images using the Hot Spot question function in Qualtrics</h4>
                          <p>
                            Using the hotspot feature allows you to layer “buttons” over still images, so that children 
                            can signal their answer choice by clicking on an image rather than a word. In our experience, 
                            this allows for an easier and more accessible study experience, particularly for child participants.<br><br> 

                            To begin, you will want to export or screenshot the image of your question page 
                            (typically the last build of the video you would have previously uploaded). Next, 
                            navigate to your Qualtrics survey, then click “Create a new question”, and change 
                            question type to “Hot Spot”. Upload the image of your question page either by clicking 
                            “upload a new graphic” to select an image on your computer, or select an image already 
                            saved in your Qualtrics graphics library. Make sure to adjust the width of the image 
                            appropriately (this width should match the width of the video). If your slide includes 
                            your question text, as shown in the example below, you will want to remove the sample text 
                            in the box above your image by deleting what is in the text box, and leaving a literal space “ ” 
                            otherwise Qualtrics automatically pipes in the prompt “Click to write the question text” again).<br><br>  

                            Once your image is loaded into Qualtrics, click on “Add Region” in the panel on the right, 
                            and a highlighted box will appear. Click and drag the corners of the highlighted box to resize 
                            it, and move it over what you would like to be the clickable “area” on your question image 
                            (i.e., where you want it to indicate a response; Note: For developmental research, you might 
                            want to make the clickable region a little bit bigger than the actual image you are layering 
                            it over to allow some “buffer”). Click on the text box underneath the highlighted area to 
                            manually enter a name/label for that area (see example below; Note: This text will not display 
                            to participants taking the study, but will appear in your data export when that region is selected).<br><br> 

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/hotspot.jpeg">
                            </div><br><br> 

                            The Hotspot feature has three main customizable options that you can select based on your 
                            question type: (1) interactivity, (2) visibility, and (3) validation type (please see 
                            area outlined in red, in the example image above). Interactivity refers to the way you 
                            want participants to interact with the question type. Selecting On/Off means 
                            that participants will be able to “click” or “unclick” a region to indicate their 
                            response (and will probably be the most straightforward for children), 
                            while selecting Like/Dislike allows participants to express “like”, “dislike”, or 
                            “neutral” affect toward the stimuli in that region. Visibility refers to whether or 
                            not you want participants to know that the regions you have highlighted are clickable 
                            areas. Qualtrics allows you to make regions “Hidden until hover”, or “always visible” 
                            (typically the default). Lastly, Validation Type sets parameters to how participants can 
                            respond to the question. Selecting “At least” forces participants to choose a certain amount 
                            of answers, and will not allow them to move forward until they have done so (however, you 
                            should check whether this option is permissible under your university’s IRB). Answers Range 
                            allows you to set even more detailed parameters for how participants will respond. For most 
                            of our questions that ask participants to make a binary decision, we select the Answers Range 
                            option, and leave the “At least” box empty (to not force participants to make a decision), but 
                            enter a “1” in the “No more than” box, so that participants are restricted from making more 
                            than one selection.<br><br> 

                            Currently, the description above only includes instructions for formatting square/rectangular 
                            clickable regions over images. However, Qualtrics does have the capability to create regions in 
                            customizable shapes. More information on Qualtrics’ Hot Spot function can be found here.<br><br> 
                          </p>

                          <h4>Type #2: Use a still screen of the question page and insert images as buttons below it</h4>
                          <p>This is a very easy and straightforward way to create a response question. Export a still image 
                            of your desired question page either by exporting your slides as pictures instead of movies 
                            (exact same steps except select Export To Images instead of Movies) or by taking a screenshot 
                            of the last frame. Then, upload the picture to a new question immediately following the video 
                            with the same image as the last frame (again, exact same steps as uploading a movie except 
                            select the picture icon instead of the movie icon). Remember to set the width to be the same 
                            as the width you set for the previous movie to ensure a smooth transition between the questions. 
                            Add your response choices below the still image. (You will also want to set the previous movie 
                            slide to auto-advance to the following response slide; for instructions on how to do so, please 
                            refer to # 2 under Step 10.)<br><br> 

                            As you can probably tell with some images, one limitation of this method is that it only works 
                            well when the options are presented evenly and horizontally so that you can easily set up 
                            the multiple choices to be directly below the corresponding choices in the picture. In some 
                            cases, you can work around this limitation by setting up the multiple choices to directly be 
                            picture choices. To do so, select Rich Content Editor within each of your choices (as shown 
                            below) and then upload the respective pictures you would like to present as choices.<br><br> 

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/response1.png">
                            </div>
                            </p>

                            <h4>Type #3: Directly insert response options below video</h4>
                            <p>This method is the quickest way to set up response choices but only works for 
                              certain types of studies/questions. For example, if the participant is old 
                              enough to read independently and the choices are simple text choices, you can 
                              directly set up the video within a multiple-choice question in Qualtrics and just set the 
                              text choices directly beneath it (see below for an example).<br><br>

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/response2.png">
                            </div><br><br>

                              However, one thing to consider when using this method is whether or not you want the 
                              participant to be able to respond to the question before the video stops playing (to 
                              avoid this, use the timing function; for instructions on how to do so, please refer to 
                              # 4 under Step 10). Another thing to consider is whether or not it matters for your study 
                              if the participant sees the choices before finishing watching the video (see advanced 
                              sections for how to do this). <br><br>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                      <div class="tab">

                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>Then, you can start uploading your videos. (Mass upload videos) To do so, 
                            in your desired question, enter the Rich Content Editor and click on the 
                            movie icon. Then, click on Select File From Library → Upload a New File → 
                            Choose File and then select the video you would like to upload. After 
                            clicking on Save, wait for the preview to show and then click on Advanced 
                            to enter your desired width and height (I usually set Width as 720 or 800, 
                            which is about full screen – feel free to adjust based on your study’s needs). 
                            The width and height ratio should be automatically locked, so just entering 
                            width is enough. Click Insert to save and finish.

                            Before launching, it is a good idea to go through the study link a couple of 
                            times to ensure that the study runs smoothly. If your study has narrated videos, the 
                            preview function in Qualtrics will have echoing audio (since it previews simultaneously 
                            for computer and for phone). One way to work around this is to simply test the survey 
                            through the anonymous link under Distributions → Anonymous Link. Just remember to filter 
                            out any test runs you might have done when you are analyzing the data.<br><br>

                            Once the study seems to be complete and running smoothly, you should be good to 
                            go to start collecting child development data online!

                <h3>General useful features of Qualtrics</h3>
                <p>For those who are unfamiliar with Qualtrics, here are some features that might be helpful to 
                  familiarize yourself with, both in general and especially for research in developmental psychology:</p>

                <div class="accordion-col">
                    <div class="tabs">
                      <div class="tab">
                        <input type="radio" id="qual1" name="rd">

                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>Survey Flow is a feature in Qualtrics that allows you to easily 
                            organize the survey experience for your participants. Survey Flow 
                            allows you to customize basic survey elements such as the order in 
                            which participants will see certain Blocks, but can also handle more 
                            complex survey configuration that includes Randomizers, Embedded Data, 
                            and Branching Logic. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                      <div class="tab">
                        <input type="radio" id="qual2" name="rd">
                        <label class="tab-label" for="qual2">Randomizer</label>
                        <div class="tab-content">
                          <p>
                            Nesting survey elements under the Randomizer in the Survey Flow will 
                            either display any given number of blocks or assign survey elements, 
                            at random. For using the randomizer to display blocks, you can either 
                            set your randomizer to select a given number of blocks to display (as 
                            shown in the outlined section below), or you can set it so that it displays 
                            all of the blocks you have listed, in random order. You can also sort blocks 
                            into Groups, and randomize the groups in the same way. <br><br>

                            Next, Embedded Data is one of the most useful elements made available to you 
                            in the Survey Flow. One benefit of this feature is that you can use embedded 
                            data to collect information that you will need for processing your data later on. 
                            For example, in order to keep track of participants’ survey completion, we set 
                            embedded data in each of our studies to record participants’ PANDA ID directly 
                            from the platform, at the beginning of the survey flow (see image below).<br><br> 

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/surveyflow_ID.jpeg">
                            </div><br><br>

                            Used in combination with Randomizers and Branching Logic, embedded data can even 
                            be used to organize the study experience for participants, while also making 
                            sure that you have a clean output file. In a 2x2 study design, you would need to 
                            randomly assign participants to one level for each of your two independent variables. 
                            One way to do this would be to place all potential combinations of your IV blocks (AA, 
                            AB, BA, BB) into a randomizer to display to participants. However, this could get really 
                            complicated if you have any condition-specific measures that would require complex 
                            branching logic. Instead, you can use randomizers at the beginning of your survey to 
                            set embedded data that would assign participants to one level for each of your two IVs, in 
                            order to create conditions (as shown below).<br><br>

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/conditions.png">
                            </div><br><br>

                            Now that these conditions have been created, you can use branching logic that 
                            relies on the embedded data you have set. You can create branching options that 
                            present particular blocks to participants that meet specific criteria, as shown 
                            below. One great benefit to this option is that your exported data will include columns for 
                            each of your IVs, populated with the level of that IV that participants were assigned to. <br><br>

                            <div class="center_box">
                              <img class="img_center" style="width: 60%;" src="assets/img/design/branching.jpeg">
                            </div><br><br>

                            Keeping in mind that the DiscoveriesOnline platform records participants using their webcam, 
                            you may be interested to keep track of what participants are seeing on their screen as they 
                            navigate through the survey. Luckily, this is made fairly easy by structuring your study in a 
                            way that would allow you to configure your Study Flow to collect embedded timing data (please 
                            see here for more information about how to do this). Once the embedded timing data is 
                            structured into your survey, you would be able to import the timing data into Datavyu, 
                            sync it with the video from your participants’ webcams, and know which trial participants 
                            are seeing at any given time.<br><br>

                           <p>
                            Qualtrics allows you to rename your questions on the left side of them. Doing so is not only particularly helpful for the organization of your survey but also renames your variables in your exported data file. Therefore, try to name questions with short, clear descriptions that will make your data processing and data analyses easy and straightforward.

                        <div class="tab-content">
                           <p>
                            When collecting developmental data online, there might be rare cases in which some questions are only used as part of the “game”, but will not be used for analyses. For instance, as part of a study on children’s reactions to social comparison information, we ask for the child’s name and grade level as part of the “game”. However, we are not interested in analyzing these data and do not wish to download or export these data for privacy reasons. Therefore, we can click on the down-pointing arrow icon next to a field and select “Exclude From Analysis”, which will prevent participants’ responses to this question from exporting.

                            For each question you create in Qualtrics, you can set up conditions for which it should be displayed or skipped. These functions are extremely helpful for developmental psychology research in a number of possible ways (e.g., skipping survey for those who do not give consent, displaying additional instruction only for those who do not pass a comprehension check question, displaying content only for those who are assigned to a certain condition, displaying content only for those who choose to continue in a persistence task, further inquiring extent of a choice based on a previous choice, etc.). To do so, simply select “Add Display Logic” or “Add Skip Logic” in the column that is right of the question you hope to selectively display or skip. You can add display/skip logic simply based on participants’ selections on previous questions (or which questions were displayed to the participant), or you can also use it in combination with the Embedded Data function (see above).

                            For all question types, you can also validate participants’ responses. This feature is more commonly used for open-ended responses, but can also be used for multiple-choice questions (e.g., you can choose for a customized message to pop out if the participant selects a certain choice). For open-ended responses, you can validate/invalidate based on either content or length. For content validation/invalidation settings, you can limit responses to be numeric, text (non-numeric), US phone numbers, US states, US postal codes, email addresses, dates, etc. For each type of content validation/invalidation, you can also further set restrictions. For example, when restricting a response to be numeric, you can set up the range of numbers that a participant is allowed to enter and even the maximum number of decimals. For length validation/invalidation settings, you can also restrict entries to a maximum/minimum number of characters or a range of characters.

                            Any time before you export your data from Qualtrics, you can set up how you would like Qualtrics to code participants’ responses, especially for multiple-choice questions. To do so, simply click on the settings icon on the left side of the question and select Recode Values. Then, you can set up how you would like Qualtrics to export each response choice (e.g., 0 for “No” and 1 for “Yes’).
