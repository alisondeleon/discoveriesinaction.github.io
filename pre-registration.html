              and <a href="https://osf.io/htn7z/" target="_blank">here</a>). Below, we’ve provided a template for the language we use in

              <h4>Data Collection Procedures</h4>
            <p>
               Participants will complete the study on their home or personal computers via the 
               Discoveries Online research platform, developed specifically for remote developmental 
               research. This platform captures both video and survey data from participating families. 
               Participants on the platform are recruited in a multitude of ways, including but not 
               limited to: community outreach events, social media advertising, posts on Prolific, and 
               volunteer sign-ups at in-person data collection sites. For this particular study, we 
               will only recruit participants with children between the ages of 4.5-7.99 years. Parents 
               of eligible children will be contacted via email and offered the opportunity to log-on 
               and participate. Children and parents will then follow an IRB-approved consent and assent 
               procedure. The study will be presented as a series of short videos and verbally narrated 
               questions, which children will respond to by clicking on the designated “buttons” to 
               indicate their response. If children are unable to maneuver the mouse and click on the 
               buttons themselves, parents will be encouraged to do the clicking for children (without 
               altering their children’s responses or providing feedback in any way). At the end of the 
               session, families will be compensated with a $10 Amazon gift card for their participation.

            <h4>Stopping Rule</h4>
            <p>
             We plan to stop data collection in the week when we have obtained usable data from at 
             least 220 participants in each sample (or once we have obtained usable data from 50 
             participants per condition; whichever comes first). We will intentionally over-sample 
             in this way to account for drops, which occur at a rate of approximately 10% of the full sample 
             for online data collection based on previous work (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/nb6ys/" target="_blank">Leshin, Leslie, & Rhodes, under review</a>).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pt-4" >
            <h4>Data Exclusion</h4>
            <p>
             All videos of participating children will be coded to make sure a visible child is participating 
             in order to be included in the sample and that a parent provides verbal consent. Previous 
             unmoderated remote research with children using similar methods has found very low rates 
             of parent or sibling interference (less than 1% of trials), and excluding such trials had 
             no consequence for the overall pattern of findings (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/nb6ys/" target="_blank">
              Leshin et al., under review</a>). Therefore, 
             we will randomly select 20% of videos to be coded by a trained researcher in order to estimate 
             the interference rate. If it is within the bounds of the interference level found in previous 
             work, we will conclude that the interference level is negligible and highly unlikely to influence 
             the study patterns and therefore retain all trials for analyses. However, if the interference 
             rate in the subset of coded videos is more than the rate estimated from previous work, then we 
             instead code every video trial-by-trial for instances of parental interference (with 20% also 
             checked by a reliability coder), and we will exclude any trials where the parent or a sibling 
             interferes such that there is a question of whether the answer reflects the child’s response. 
             If more than 25% of a child’s responses are excluded for this reason, the participant’s data 
             will be dropped from analyses. Our guide to interference coding is 
             <a href="assets/resources/preregistration/panda_codingmanual_zarpie.docx">available here</a> (note: this guide is currently under revision, and an updated version will be posted to this site as soon as it is ready).  
            <br><br>        
            We do not plan to exclude based on children's success on manipulation checks and comprehension 
            questions; however, if more than 25% of our sample fails these, we will conduct planned 
            exploratory analyses including just the subsample of participants who passed the respective 
            measures. We plan to report the percentage of participants who passed and did not pass these 
            comprehension checks.</p>

            <h4>Missing Data</h4>
            <p>Partial data from participants will be included if at least 50% of items are complete; 
                participants with less than 50% completion will be excluded. We also plan to exclude 
                any participants who are not within our age-range of 4.5-7.99 years old. For partial 
                data that is included, we plan to just look at scores  out of total responses completed.</p>
